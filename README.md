## EmbedRT

EmbedRT is a shorthand for Embedded Reactive Tensor, a math processing compiler for x86_64 & ARM based targets. ASIC & FPGA support is also in pipeline. 


### EmbedRT has three components

- Utils - A set of highly deterministic high precision timing utilities.
- Tensor Library - High level algebra and computation library.
- Device Library - This supports cross-target compilation for ARM targets.
